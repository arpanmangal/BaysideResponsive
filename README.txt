    A sample website made while learning. Based on
    Adobe Dreamweaver tutorial -> https://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/how-to/make-website-pt1-site-setup.html?
    but none less than a ready to be deployed full fleged website.
    
    Currently it consists of a HOME page and SIGHTS page as according to the tutorial.
    In addition a DINING page has been added which is partially based on the actual Bayside Beat website.
    Other elements like a 'San Deigo Vacation Travel Guide' video included in the actual website also have been added.
